# - Capture:
# Macros should in general not contain capture groups.
# Those that do contain capture groups should be prefixed with 'Cn-' where
# n is the number of capture groups the macro contains
#
# - Referencing other macros:
# Macros are replaced from first to last in order. Therefore, macros are
# only allowed to reference macros that come later in the macro file.
# Note that quad-dollar-signs are needed when referencing other macros
# in the macro file. This is due to escaping behavior of dollar signs in
# yaml files
